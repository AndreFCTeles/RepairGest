Axios and Ajax are both methods for making asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript, but they differ in their implementation and usage.

Ajax:
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):

Definition: Ajax is a technique used in web development to create asynchronous web applications. It allows you to update parts of a web page with new data without requiring a full page reload.
Implementation: In its basic form, Ajax is not a library or a framework; it's a set of web development techniques that use a combination of XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects and JavaScript to exchange data with a server asynchronously.
Usage: Developers manually handle XMLHttpRequest and manage callbacks to handle responses and update the DOM.
Axios:
Axios:

Definition: Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. It is not specific to any particular environment and can be used both in the browser and on the server (Node.js).
Implementation: Axios is built on top of the XMLHttpRequest object (in the browser) or the HTTP module (in Node.js). It provides a simple and clean API for making HTTP requests and handling responses.
Usage: Developers can use Axios to make HTTP requests more conveniently compared to using the raw XMLHttpRequest. Axios supports Promises, which simplifies handling asynchronous code and makes it easier to manage the flow of data.
Key Differences:
API Design:

Ajax: Requires the manual creation of XMLHttpRequest objects and handling callbacks for success or failure.
Axios: Provides a more user-friendly and modern API. It returns Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous code, and it supports async/await syntax.
Promises:

Ajax: Typically relies on callback functions for handling asynchronous operations.
Axios: Supports Promises, making it more convenient to work with asynchronous code and allowing for cleaner, more readable code.
Browser Compatibility:

Ajax: XMLHttpRequest is supported in modern browsers, but the code might vary slightly between them.
Axios: Provides a consistent API across different browsers and is often considered more user-friendly.
Features:

Ajax: Provides the core functionality for making asynchronous requests but might lack some features that are available in higher-level libraries or frameworks.
Axios: Comes with built-in features such as the ability to intercept requests and responses, set default configurations, and automatically transform JSON data.
In summary, while Ajax is a technique involving manual handling of XMLHttpRequest, Axios is a library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests by providing a cleaner API, supporting Promises, and offering additional features. Axios is often the preferred choice in modern web development due to its ease of use and flexibility.

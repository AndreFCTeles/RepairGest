Expo is a set of tools and services for building React Native applications more easily. It provides an abstraction layer over React Native that simplifies the development process and allows developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with certain platform-specific configurations. Here's an overview of Expo and how it relates to React Native:

Expo Overview:
Development Environment:

Expo offers a development environment that includes a command-line interface (CLI) and a client app (Expo Go) that you can install on your mobile device.
Managed Workflow:

Expo operates on a managed workflow, handling many aspects of the development process for you. This includes managing dependencies, building, and packaging your application.
Built-in Libraries and APIs:

Expo comes with a set of pre-configured native modules and APIs that you can use in your application, such as camera, geolocation, and push notifications.
Expo SDK:

The Expo SDK provides a set of APIs that abstract away some of the complexities of working directly with native modules. These APIs are accessible through JavaScript.
Expo Go:

Expo Go is a mobile app available on iOS and Android that allows you to preview and test your Expo projects without having to build a standalone binary.
Expo and React Native:
Abstraction Layer:

Expo sits on top of React Native and provides an additional layer of abstraction. It allows you to build React Native applications without having to write native code or interact directly with native modules.
Simplified Development:

With Expo, you can develop React Native applications more easily without the need to set up and configure native development environments.
Managed Workflow:

Expo's managed workflow is designed to simplify the development process by handling many tasks, such as dependency management, building, and deployment.
Differences Between React Native and Expo + React Native:
Setup and Configuration:

React Native: Requires manual setup and configuration of native development environments for iOS and Android using Xcode and Android Studio.
Expo + React Native: Provides a managed workflow, eliminating the need for complex setup.
Native Modules and APIs:

React Native: Requires linking native modules and configuring native APIs manually for certain functionalities.
Expo + React Native: Comes with a set of pre-configured native modules and APIs that are readily available.
Development Environment:

React Native: Works with a standard React Native CLI.
Expo + React Native: Uses the Expo CLI and Expo Go for development and testing.
Dependency Management:

React Native: Requires manual linking of native dependencies.
Expo + React Native: Manages dependencies automatically in the managed workflow.
Ejecting:

React Native: Allows "ejecting" from Expo to a standard React Native project if you need more control over native code.
Expo + React Native: Offers the option to eject to a standard React Native project.
Choosing between React Native and Expo depends on the specific requirements of your project. Expo is excellent for quickly prototyping and building applications with a streamlined development process. However, if your project requires extensive customization, integration with specific native modules, or direct control over the native code, you might opt for a standard React Native project.

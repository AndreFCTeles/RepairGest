When you develop a Next.js application, the term "server" is used in a dual context, which can sometimes cause confusion. Let's break it down:

Development Server:

During development, when you run npm run dev or yarn dev, Next.js starts a development server. This server is responsible for serving your Next.js application during development.
It supports features like hot module replacement (HMR) and automatic rebuilding when you make changes to your code.
Production Server:

When you are ready to deploy your Next.js application to a production environment, you need to set up a production server. This is a separate server that will handle the incoming requests for your application.
Next.js applications are often deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or custom server environments.
Migrating to a Physical Server:
If you are considering migrating your application to a physical server (e.g., a server you manage, a virtual private server, or a cloud server), here are the general steps:

Prepare for Deployment:

Ensure that your application is ready for deployment. This involves running any necessary build commands and creating a production-ready build of your application.
Choose a Hosting Solution:

Decide where you want to host your application. This could be on a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or a server from a hosting provider.
Set Up a Server:

Provision a physical server or a virtual private server (VPS) if you don't already have one.
Install Node.js and any other dependencies your application may need.
Copy Your Application:

Transfer your application code and any necessary files to the server. This could involve using SCP, SFTP, or any other file transfer method.
Install Dependencies:

On the server, install the dependencies needed for your application using npm install or yarn install.
Configure Environment Variables:

Set up environment variables on the server, especially those needed for configuration in a production environment.
Run the Application:

Start your Next.js application on the server using a process manager like PM2 or a tool like forever. This ensures that your application continues running even if the terminal is closed.
Set Up Reverse Proxy (Optional):

If you are using a server like Nginx or Apache, you may need to set up a reverse proxy to forward requests to your Next.js application.
Configure Security:

Implement security best practices, including setting up firewalls, securing your server, and using HTTPS.
Monitor and Maintain:

Implement monitoring solutions to keep track of your application's health and performance.
Regularly update your server's operating system, dependencies, and your application itself.
It's worth noting that while deploying to a physical server is an option, many developers and organizations prefer using Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions, such as Vercel or Netlify, which abstract away server management tasks and simplify the deployment process. These services often provide easy integration with Next.js and take care of scaling, deployment, and other infrastructure concerns.
